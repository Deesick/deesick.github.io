Welcome to **HackwithDeesick**

My name is Deesick. I am a penetration tester who specializes in Active Directory assessments and web-application security. I design and execute real-world attack simulations that help organizations strengthen their defenses against emerging security threats.

This website chronicles my journey from its very beginning to where I'm at currently. Here, youâ€™ll find tips, write-ups, notes and reflections drawn from my own practical experiences. Whether youâ€™re just starting out or already deep in the trenches, I hope you find something useful here that can support your growth.
